# Implementation-of-a-filtering-system(Firewalls)
This project focuses on analyzing and implementing two robust filtering technologies: Iptables on Linux and Cisco ASA under Packet Tracer. It highlights the importance of network security in mitigating cyber threats and ensuring operational continuity.

Key Features:
Iptables on Linux: Explores packet filtering, NAT, and security rule configurations, leveraging its open-source flexibility for managing network traffic.
Cisco ASA: Simulates an enterprise-grade security infrastructure with advanced features like centralized management, VPN, and access control lists (ACLs).
Comparison and Selection: Provides an in-depth comparison of the two systems, offering insights into their strengths and suitability for different environments.
Outcomes:
Designed and configured secure network architectures.
Developed and tested practical security rules.
Assessed the resilience of configurations using real-world attack scenarios.
